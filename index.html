      <p class="description">
        <strong>Sailor Moon </strong>is an a manga created and illustrated by
        Naoko Takeuchi from 1991 to 1997. Her manga was later adapted into an
        anime series produced by Toei Animation and broadcasted in Japan from
        1992 to 1997
        <br />

        I love this anime because it is the first anime I watched depicting
        female super heroes. I imagined having friends like the Sailor Scouts
        someday just like Naoko Takeuchi did when she created this anime. I ran
        from school daily just to watch new episodes aired at 5pm. This was the
        highlight of my day during my elementary school life. I am still a fan
        and continue to watch the new movies and rewatch old series from time to
        time. Below is a short introduction of each sailor scout.
